# Pinkka Species Learning Environment

Welcome to my concept for a new Pinkka â€“ the University of Helsinki's species database and learning tool.

## Opensource Technology
Node.js, Sails.js, MongoDB

## Responsive Layout
"One size fits all." By using a grid structure that automatically adapts to different device widths, we ensure that the system will work on tablets and phones as well as laptops and desktop terminals.

A native application and local database for iOS and Android are on the roadmap however, to improve responsiveness, particularly for field work without a reliable network connection.

## API Layer
There are many biological databases, and a need for interoperability between them. Having an API layer integrated with the application ensures that lists and data can be exchanged with ease.

## Real-time Collaboration
Websockets for discussion and remote learning.
